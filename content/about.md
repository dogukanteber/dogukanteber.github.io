I am a fourth-year software engineering student at Yasar University. I have experience in different fields of software engineering such as game programming, back-end development, security, and so on. I am proficient in C, Python, and Bash programming languages. Other languages that I am familiar with are C++, Java, and Javascript. I am now learning Go and CUDA and am exploring artificial intelligence and supercomputing.
