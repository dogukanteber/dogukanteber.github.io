I am a fourth-year software engineering student at Yasar University. I have experience in different fields of software engineering such as game programming, back-end development, and security. I am proficient in C, Python, Java and Bash programming languages. Other languages that I am familiar with are C++, Go, and Javascript. I am interested in supercomputing and artificial intelligence. I am doing my bachelor thesis on target coverage problem in WSNs. I am trying to solve the target coverage problem by implementing Genetic Algorithm in serial and parallel. I am also learning machine learning, more specifically reinforcement learning.
