### [targus](https://github.com/Yasar-University-Software-Engineering/targus)
targus is a tool that solves the target coverage problem in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). It provides an easy-to-use interface that lets you create your own problem instance, solve it, and give statistical information.

The aim of the project is to maximize the lifetime to monitor the target points for k-coverage and m-connected node placement in target-based wireless sensor networks. The Genetic Algorithm is used to solve the target coverage problem by applying local search in each iteration.
