      <title>Genetic Algorithm</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-the-genetic-algorithm&#34;&gt;What is the Genetic Algorithm?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to problems that can be represented as a set of discrete values. This heuristic is often used in optimization and machine learning problems. The genetic algorithm works by creating a population of potential solutions and then iteratively improving the population by applying a set of operators, such as selection, crossover, and mutation. It is a type of optimization algorithm that is inspired by the process of natural selection. The algorithm mimics the process of natural selection in order to find the best solution to a problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Univariate Linear Regression Implementation Using Gradient Descent Algorithm</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Linear regression is one of the basic and powerful algorithms in machine learning. In this post, I will try to explain how to implement linear regression using a gradient descent algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before jumping right into the code, let me briefly talk about what linear regression is. Linear regression is one of the supervised learning algorithms. It performs a regression task and models a target prediction value based on independent variables. The independent variables are also called features. However, for now, we will only focus on one variable. Hence, the name univariate linear regression.&#xA;In the end, we want a linear function that fits optimally for the given data set. We can represent this function as:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Parallel Programming in OpenFOAM</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/featured_image.png&#34; alt=&#34;OpenFOAM logo&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OpenFOAM is a widely used CFD toolbox in academia and industry. It is also used to solve HPC problems related to fluid dynamics. However, some problems can take too much time to execute. For computation-heavy problems, parallel programming can dramatically reduce the computation time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OpenFOAM has native support for parallel programming with MPI but writing parallel programs in OpenFOAM is not the same as writing parallel programs with MPI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can You Briefly Explain The Domain Decomposition Method?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/domain-decomposition/</link>

      <description>&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;images/featured_image.png&#34; alt=&#34;The 3D domain decomposition of original computation domain&#34;/&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figcaption&gt;The 3D domain decomposition of original computation domain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before the Summer of HPC started, my mentor contacted us and gave us an exercise to familiarize ourselves with the MPI library and parallel programming. The exercise required us to use the domain decomposition method and at that time, I had no idea what it is. I searched the Web to learn more about it and eventually solved the exercise but it was difficult topic to learn, especially for beginners who have not experienced parallel programming before. Therefore, in this blog post, I will try to explain the domain decomposition method briefly and at the end of the post, I will leave a link to a GitHub repository that contains the exercise description and its solution. Keep in mind that I am not aiming to tell you everything about the domain decomposition but rather scratch the surface. Before further ado, let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
